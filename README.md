## ‚≠ê How it works

- GitHub Actions is used as an uptime monitor
  - Every 5 minutes, a workflow visits your website to make sure it's up
  - Response time is recorded every 6 hours and committed to git
  - Graphs of response time are generated every day
- GitHub Issues is used for incident reports
  - An issue is opened if an endpoint is down
  - People from your team are assigned to the issue
  - Incidents reports are posted as issue comments
  - Issues are locked so non-members cannot comment on them
  - Issues are closed automatically when your site comes back up
  - Slack notifications are sent on updates
- GitHub Pages is used for the status website
  - A simple, beautiful, and accessible PWA is generated
  - Built with Svelte and Sapper
  - Fetches data from this repository using the GitHub API
